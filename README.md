Python for Java Developers 

We want to show the differences and similarities between Java and Python using some examples.

Therefore, we could implement a simple ToDo-List application implemented in Spring Boot and with Flask. This should showcase how requests, CRUD methods, JPA (?), deployment practices and CI/CD pipelines.

Another idea is to provide snippets showing how standard operations are done in Java vs in Python.

Another cool thing would be to redo famous katas, like the bowling kata, in python.
